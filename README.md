# ⚔️ 2D Platformer – *Jump King*-Inspired  

This is a 2D platformer game in development, inspired by the mechanics of *Jump King*. The focus is on precision platforming, where players must master charged jumps to ascend challenging environments.  

## 🎮 Core Features  

- **Charged Jump Mechanic**:  
  - Hold down the jump key to charge and release for varying jump heights and distances.  
  - Master the timing and angle for precise movement.  

- **Raycasting for Collision Detection**:  
  - Accurate ground and wall detection for responsive jumping and landing.  
  - Raycasting is used to manage collision interactions and prevent clipping.  

- **Dynamic Platforming** *(planned features)*:  
  - Moving and disappearing platforms to add complexity.  
  - Environmental hazards like spikes and wind zones.  

- **Physics-Based Gameplay**:  
  - Momentum and gravity play a key role in navigating levels.  
  - Players must consider the environment and plan their jumps accordingly.  

## 🕹️ Controls
